# DOM Manipulation Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, we will practice DOM manipulation. ü•≥

Once you download the starter code, you will find your tasks in the `index.html` file. Read the file carefully.

You will complete the tasks by only working on the `solution.js` file. Do not touch the `index.html`, `reset.js`, and `test.js` files.

Tasks initially have the red tick (‚ùå), indicating **not completed yet**. Once you complete a task, the `test.js` file detects it by running tests and automatically changes it to the green tick (‚úÖ) icon, indicating **completed**.

If you run the `index.html` file in a live server, it automatically detects changes you made in files, re-runs the tests, and updates the screen accordingly. If not, please refresh the browser to re-run the tests.
